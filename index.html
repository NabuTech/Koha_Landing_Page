            I thought I would make a post to introduce myself! 
            <br>
            For those who don't know me,
            <br>
            I'm Aroha 🙋🏽‍♀️

            And owner of Koha Cleaning Services 💚🖤
            <br>
            I have been cleaning now for most of my adult life! Literally as a māmā 😂 and professionally! 
            <br>
            Prior to children I was a courier driver which I absolutely loved, most of the time but my passion for cleaning and being that helping hand for other whānau has grown over the years and I now absolutely love what I do! 
            <br>
            A few years ago I started A&H Cleaning Services and have now decided to branch out and create my own cleaning bizzo to provide for my wee whānau while still being able to be present for my babies 😊
            <br>
            I chose the name "Koha" as I would love to eventually be able to "gift back" to the community with monthly donations to some awesome kaupapa in Ōtautahi! 
            <br>
            I have a few in mind that have helped me navigate some difficult times in my life, and I will share these with you as my business builds! 
            <br>
            For now, if I have ever cleaned for you or if you are lucky enough to be one of my regular clients I would hugely appreciate if you could show a little love and give my new page a like/share and also leave me a review! 
            <br>
            Ngā mihinui whānau!
